The project provides over 120 commands but fear not, much has been done
to make them *discoverable*, *memorable* and hopefully in many cases *obvious*.

The reference material below is all extracted from the source of the commands.
While not necessary to use the commands. Be curious. Read the source. :-)

Lists in this project are alphabetised except where it makes sense not to.
The first few sets of commands were chosen because they are likely to be of
the most interest to readers.

!!! Note "General Rules"
    - Commands expect `$AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` environment variable to be set
      (check/set with `region` command)
    - Most commands that list resources (`stacks`, `instances , etc)
      accept filter term as first arg.
        - *e.g. `stacks blah` is equivalent to `stacks | grep blah`*
    - Most commands accept resource identifiers via STDIN
      (first token of each line)
    - Resources are generally listed in chronological order of creation.
